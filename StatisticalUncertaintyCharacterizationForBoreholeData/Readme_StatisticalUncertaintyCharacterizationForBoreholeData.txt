Program name: StatisticalUncertaintyCharacterizationForBoreholeData
--
  This program is used to characterize the statistical uncertainty of borehole data obtained by the 
geotechnical field investigation. By this program, the equivalent samples of statistical charactertistics
(i.e. mean, var, and SOF (scale of fluctuation)) can be obtained, and then, the quantiles and confidence
interval of equivalent samples can be used to quantify the statistical uncertainty. For some technical 
details, the users can refer to Han et al. (2022).

  Users can run this program by following the instructions in the user manual.

Program introduction:
  This program is used to characterize the statistical uncertainty of borehole data obtained by the 
geotechnical field investigation. By this program, the equivalent samples of statistical charactertistics
(i.e. mean, var, and SOF (scale of fluctuation)) can be obtained, and then, the quantiles and confidence
interval of equivalent samples can be used to quantify the statistical uncertainty. For some technical 
details, the users can refer to Han et al. (2022a).

Impletementation procedure
1. Installation
  There are two stratgies to install the package.
  (1) In order to install the package, put the files to a folder of your choice and add this package
folder to the MATLAB path.
  (2) For simplicity, users can also directly put the files to a new folder within the "bin" folder under 
the installation path of MATLAB. For instance, in the example case, the package folder is 
"D:\Program Files\MATLAB\R2022b\bin\CodeTest"
--
2. Data preparation
  (1) Prepare the borehole data regarding a certain geo-material parameter in a specific site. Put the borehole 
data into the file named as "BoreholeData.txt". In "BoreholeData.txt", 1st column is the site ID. Generally, the 
statistical uncertainty characterization only care about one site, and hence, the site ID can be a any number 
such as 1. Then, 2nd column contains the depth data, and 3rd column contains the geo-material parameteric data 
in the specific site.
  (2) Prepare the background data regarding the geo-material parameter in "BoreholeData_Clay_10_7490.txt" and put 
it into the file named as "BackgroundData.txt". In "BackgroundData.txt", 1st column contains the site ID information, 
2nd column contains the depth data of each site, and 3rd column contains the geo-material parameteric data of each site.
  Note: if the geo-material parameter for study is a non-negative variable, the lognormal transformation should 
applied to it. In the example, the geo-material parameter for study is the liquid index (LI) that can be negative,
and as a result, the lognormal transformation is not required for LI.

3. Obtain the basic parameters for statistical uncertainty characterization
  To obtain the basic parameters for statistical uncertainty characterization, the program named as 
"BasicParametersEstimation_master.m" should be run. In the program above, several arguments should be modified before
running.
  (1) Modify the argument "datasetname". The argument "datasetname" specifies the dataset name. In the example case,
the dataset name is "BackgroundData.txt".
  (2) Modify the argument "ACF". "ACF" specifies the type of auto-correlation function. The meanings of differnt numbers
are as follows:
    ACF=1: Markovian (single exponential) function model. rho=exp(-2*|tau|/sof)
    ACF=2: Spherical function model.rho=(1-|tau|/sof), tau<=sof; rho=0, otherwise
    ACF=3: Second-order Markov function model. rho=exp(-4*|tau|/sof)*(1+4*|tau|/sof)
    ACF=4: Gaussian (squared exponential) function model. rho=exp(-pi()*(tau/sof)^2)
where tau represents the distance between two positions, and sof represents the value for scale of fluctuation.
  In the example, the single exponential function model is adopted, that is, ACF=1.
  (3) Press the running button in MATLAB platform to perform this program. During the calculation, the curve of SOF values
versus likelihood function value will be plotted for checking the computing process in time.
  (4) Read the results of basic parameters. The results will directly be displayed in the command window, in which the user 
mainly focus on these 6 terms, namely mean_mean, mean_var, alpha_sigma0, beta_sigma0, sof_mean, and sof_var. These 6 terms
will be used for statistical uncertainty characterization. In the program named as "StatisticalUncertaintyAnalysisAdvanced_master.m",
these 6 terms are storaged in the argument "BaiscParameters" as follows:
    BaiscParameters = [mean_mean, mean_var;
		       alpha_sigma0; beta_sigma0;
                        sof_mean, sof_var];

4. Obtain the initial statistics of the borehole data for study
  To speed up the calculation, the initial values are much important. Accordingly, the initial parameter values of borebole
data should be figured out. To achieve this, the program named as "InitialParametersEstimation_master.m" should be run.
  (1) Modify the argument "datasetname". The argument "datasetname" specifies the dataset name. In the example case,
the dataset names are "BoreholeData_LI_Onsoy site.txt" and "BoreholeData_LI_selected 31 sites.txt", respectively.
  (2) Modify the argument "ACF". The meaning of ACF here is same as before. In the example case, the ACF takes 1.
  (3) Press the running button in MATLAB platform to perform this program. 
  (4) Read the results of initial statistics. In this step, the results of initial statistics are stroaged in the argument
named as "initial_statisitcs" located at the end line of this program. In the argument "initial_statisitcs", the 1st column
contains the site ID information, 2nd~4th columns contain the mean, variance, and SOF values, respectively. Users can copy the
results and paste them into the file storaging initial statistics of the borehole data for use in the next step. In the example
case, the files are named as "InitialStatistics_LI_Onsoy site.txt" and "InitialStatistics_LI_selected 31 sites.txt", which 
corresponds to the borehole datasets "InitialStatistics_LI_Onsoy site.txt" and "InitialStatistics_LI_selected 31 sites", respectively.

5. Characterize the statistical uncertainty
  After obtaining the basic parameters and the initial parameter values, the statistical uncertainty of borehole data can
be performed. To achieve this, the program named as "StatisticalUncertaintyAnalysisAdvanced_master.m" should be run.
  (1) Modify the argument "BoreholeDataName". The argument "BoreholeDataName" specifies the dataset name of the borehole for study.
In the example case, the dataset names is "BoreholeData_LI_Onsoy site.txt" and "BoreholeData_LI_selected 31 sites.txt". 
  (2) Modify the argument "InitialStatisticName". The argument "InitialStatisticName" specifies the initial statistics of the
geo-material parameter in borehole data for study.
  (3) Modify the argument "filesavepath". The argument "filesavepath" is used to specify the saving path of calculation results. In 
the example, the saving path is "D:\CodeTest\SUCA_LI_Onsoy".
  (4) Modify the argument "datatype". If the geo-material parameter is non-negative, the lognormal transformation is suggested to 
be applied to it. Otherwise, the geo-material parameter can be handled in the original form. In the example case, the geo-material
parameter is LI that can be negative, and hence, the lognormal transformation is not required.
  (5) Modify the argument "ACF". The meaning of ACF here is same as before.
  (6) Modify the argument "BaiscParameters". the argument "BaiscParameters" storages the basic parameters for statistical uncertainty
characterization, and the basic parameters are obtained by the work in section 2 in this manual.
  (7) Press the running button in MATLAB platform to perform this program. When the calculation is completed, three figures will be 
displayed, which presents the histgrams of equivalent samples of three statistical characteristics (i.e. mean, var, and SOF).

6. Read results of statistical uncertainty characterization
  According to the specified saving path, results of statistical uncertainty characterization can be found. In the example case, the
saving path is "D:\CodeTest\SUCA_LI". In the result folder, there are 5 kinds of files, including "ACFID_CRF_Params.txt", 
 "ACFID_equivalent_samples_site-ID.txt", "ACFID_equivalent_mu_statistics.txt", "ACFID_equivalent_sof_statistics.txt", and 
"ACFID_equivalent_var_statistics.txt". In the example case, ACF takes 1, and site ID is 1 in the borehole data file. Hence, these 
files are named as "ACF1_CRF_Params.txt",  "ACF1_equivalent_samples_site-1.txt", "ACF1_equivalent_mu_statistics.txt", "ACF1_equivalent_sof_statistics.txt", and "ACF1_equivalent_var_statistics.txt".
  (1) File named as "ACFID_equivalent_samples_site-ID.txt" contains equivalent samples of three statistical characteristics for the 
specified site with ID information, namely mean, var, and sof. The default number of samples is 10000.
  (2) File named as "ACFID_equivalent_mu_statistics.txt" contains the statistical of mean samples such as the 5% quantile (denoted as
p5), mean, and 90% confidence interval (denoted as CI90). Note: 95% CI is defined by 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles, 90% CI is defined by
5% and 95% quantiles, and 80% CI is defined by 10% and 90% quantiles. 
  (3) File named as "ACFID_equivalent_var_statistics.txt" contains the statistical of var samples.
  (4) File named as "ACFID_equivalent_sof_statistics.txt" contains the statistical of sof samples.
  (5) File named as "ACF1_CRF_Params.txt" mainly serves the realization of Bayesian-based conditional random field, and hence, this 
file contains the updated mean, standard deviation, and SOF values. Besides, the Bayesian-based conditional random field generally
needs the lower and upper bounds of mean (i.e. 10% and 90% quantiles), and these hyper-parameters (i.e. lower and upper bounds of
mean) are also presented in this file. For the Bayesian-based conditional random field, the users can refer to Jiang et al. (2018)
and Han et al. (2022b).

Note:
  In CLAY/10/7490 database, it is found that the geo-meterial parametric data in No.713 site is same with No. 706 site, and as a result,
the No.713 site is excluded from the study.

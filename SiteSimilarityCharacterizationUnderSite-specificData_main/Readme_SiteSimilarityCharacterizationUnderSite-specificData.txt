Program name: SiteSimilarityCharacterizationUnderSite-specificData_main
--
 This program is designed to characterize the site similairty under the site-specific scenario. This 
program has four highlights:
  (1) The similarity degree is a monotonic and absolute indicator with the range of [0, 1].
  (2) The site similarity characterization is based on the geo-material parameteric data, and hence,
the site similarity can be characterized in three views, namely the mean vector, standard deviation 
vector, and the correlation coefficient matrix. Aa a result, the site similarity can be characterized
in more detail.
  (3) The uncertainty of site similarity characterization results from the field investigation data 
can be considered.
  (4) The vertical spatial correlation of geo-material parameter along the borehole can be considered.

  In this program, one section is to construct the site-specific multivariate normal distribution model, which is 
inspried by Ching and Phoon (2020). Therefore, for the construction of site-specific multivariate distribution model, the 
users can also refer to  Ching and Phoon (2020).
